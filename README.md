# Introduction

Low back pain (LBP) remains the most prevalent and costly work-related disability in the United States, accounting for ~40% of all work-related musculoskeletal disorders and over $50 billion in treatment costs. The development of LBP has been directly associated with “physical” risk factors, including overexertion, repetitive lifting, and prolonged/sustained non-neutral trunk postures. Back-support exoskeletons (BSEs) have emerged recently as a new and promising ergonomic intervention to mitigate the risk of LBP, by reducing muscular exertion and spine loading. Understanding both the “intended” and “unintended” consequences of BSE use on physical risk factors for LBP, however, is an essential prerequisite for the safe and effective implementation of this technology in actual workplaces. The purpose of this work is, therefore, to evaluate the consequences of BSE use in manual material handling tasks and to contribute to future ergonomic and safety guidelines for more efficient and effective use of occupational exoskeletons. 

BSEs are wearable assistive devices designed to support, augment, and/or assist with the back and hip muscles by producing restorative torques. This is done passively by the means of springs and/or elastic materials, or actively through use of powered actuators. At present, passive BSEs are predominant in the commercial market and in the existing literature in the occupational domain. While the development of active devices is still in progress, concerns exist regarding their cost-effectiveness and ease of adoption. There has been a general consistency throughout the literature regarding the benefits of passive BSEs in reducing trunk extensor muscle activity. However, inferences regarding the effects of a BSE use on spine loadings are premature without consideration of other trunk elements (e.g., deep muscles and passive tissues) as well as body and external load kinematics. As such, the degree to which different BSE designs actually decrease spine loads (i.e., compressive and shear forces) is yet to be explored sufficiently. 

This study aims to quantify the changes in spine loads resulting from BSE use during a repetitive lifting task. Compression and shear forces at the lumbosacral level are determined using an optimization-based approach to estimate muscle forces (in the AnyBody™ commercial model). To obtain critical input to this model, a novel approach has been used to characterize BSE mechanics. This code runs an inverse dynamic analysis to calculate the joint reaction forces when wearing back-support exoskeletons during a repetitive lifting task.
