# Introduction

Low back pain (LBP) remains the most prevalent and costly work-related disability in the United States, accounting for ~40% of all work-related musculoskeletal disorders and over $50 billion in treatment costs. The development of LBP has been directly associated with “physical” risk factors, including overexertion, repetitive lifting, and prolonged/sustained non-neutral trunk postures. Back-support exoskeletons (BSEs) have emerged recently as a new and promising ergonomic intervention to mitigate the risk of LBP, by reducing muscular exertion and spine loading. Understanding both the “intended” and “unintended” consequences of BSE use on physical risk factors for LBP, however, is an essential prerequisite for the safe and effective implementation of this technology in actual workplaces. The purpose of this work is, therefore, to evaluate the consequences of BSE use in manual material handling tasks and to contribute to future ergonomic and safety guidelines for more efficient and effective use of occupational exoskeletons. 

BSEs are wearable assistive devices designed to support, augment, and/or assist with the back and hip muscles by producing restorative torques. This is done passively by the means of springs and/or elastic materials, or actively through use of powered actuators. At present, passive BSEs are predominant in the commercial market and in the existing literature in the occupational domain. While the development of active devices is still in progress, concerns exist regarding their cost-effectiveness and ease of adoption. There has been a general consistency throughout the literature regarding the benefits of passive BSEs in reducing trunk extensor muscle activity. However, inferences regarding the effects of a BSE use on spine loadings are premature without consideration of other trunk elements (e.g., deep muscles and passive tissues) as well as body and external load kinematics. As such, the degree to which different BSE designs actually decrease spine loads (i.e., compressive and shear forces) is yet to be explored sufficiently. 

This study aims to quantify the changes in spine loads resulting from BSE use during a repetitive lifting task. Compression and shear forces at the lumbosacral level are determined using an optimization-based approach to estimate muscle forces (in the AnyBody™ commercial model). To obtain critical input to this model, a novel approach has been used to characterize BSE mechanics. This code runs an inverse dynamic analysis to calculate the joint reaction forces when wearing back-support exoskeletons during a repetitive lifting task.

# Implementationn

An inertial motion capture system (MVN Awinda, Xsens Technologies B.V., the Netherlands) was used to capture whole-body kinematics during a repetitive lifting task. Measured kinematics data were exported from Xsens MVN Studio and imported into the AnyBody Modeling System (AMS), in which a linked-segment model with 44 degrees of freedom WAS reconstructed [Larsen et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10439-019-02409-8). To match the linked-segment model with the musculoskeletal model, I utilized an established approach involving virtual markers, minimizing linear distances between the virtual markers and the musculoskeletal model. Muscle activations and internal reaction forces will then be computed through an inverse dynamic analysis (top-down approach) by minimizing muscle activation levels to solve the problem of kinetic redundancy (or, the muscle distribution problem) ([Ansersen et al. 2010](https://doi.org/10.1080/10255840903067080), [Damsgaard et al. 2007](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.simpat.2006.09.001)). Note that participant weight, height, and other anthropometric data (e.g., trunk length, shoulder width, hip width, arm span) were used to scale body segment masses and lengths in the AMS. A mechanical interface for each BSE were created in the AMS platform, consisting of a torso frame hinged to two leg frames at the hip joint. Kinematics of the torso and leg frames were constrained such that they follow the participant’s torso and hip motions, respectively.

The mechanical behavior of each BSE (i.e., torque vs. angle relationship) were measured in a calibration trial using a computerized isokinetic dynamometer (Humac Norm, CSMi, MA) equipped with a trunk module. The continuous passive motion (CPM) mode of the isokinetic test machine was operated at various speeds, while setting the BSE supports at different levels (instant low and instant high conditions for the BackX™ and low-cam and high-cam conditions for the Laevo™). CPM testing trials were conducted using a flexible mannequin with a hinge joint at the hip to mimic trunk flexion/extension. Ultimately, a torque profile was derived as a function of angular velocity and angular position to estimate the assistive torque provided by the BSEs at each angular position and lifting speed.
